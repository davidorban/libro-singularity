Is freedom an emergent property of self-organizing matter? We strongly believe to be endowed of free will, and most of our social structures are based on this. There is no physical foundation to it. The determinism of physical laws, quantum uncertainties notwithstanding, allows no space for the concept to hide and show its effects. Just as we are constantly moved to anthropomorphizing objects, animals, and phenomena, we are compelled to interpret decisions as made freely instead of being the consequence of the state of matter and its interactions, inside and outside of us.

Individual behavior aggregates to that of larger groups, and finally of societies. We judge the outcomes of individual decisions and consequences in civil and criminal law. We can judge the capacity of societies to engender the well being of its members, or, on the contrary, to be corrupt, unjust, and spreading confusion, violence and suffering. 

The capacity of a group of societies to generate well being doesn’t only depend on the aggregate decisions of its members. It also depends on what knowledge is actually available to them, and through them to it. The ancient Roman civilization created wonderful art and philosophy, and we rightly admire its achievements. However, it was organized at a fundamental level on slave labor, which today is universally condemned. Could it be different? Is it possible to imagine a Roman civilization that didn’t employ slavery? It is not, because the level of knowledge, and especially the energy availability that that knowledge generated, made it impossible to achieve its goals without resorting to the force of human muscle, or programmable humans, people you could tell what to do, and who’d do it, without talking back.

During its period of expansion, while able to draw on successful waves of slaves, the Roman civilization appeared to be well adapted. It was only an appearance, because it could not last.  Rome could not further expand, having basically conquered all the available land of what we call today Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and enslaved all the individuals that could be enslaved in those populations. At that point it went into decline and became incapable of resisting the changes coming, or adapting to them. This is of course an extremely simplistic representation of a long and complex history. There are many other forces at play beyond that of slaves or the lack of slaves. 

Today, with current knowledge, we can build societies and civilizations without slaves. Relying on chemical and soon solar energy, our decisions are driven by their more efficient use, and they outcompete the eventual alternatives. We are not morally superior to the Romans as individual human beings, we are taking advantage of the accumulated information and its applications. The outcome of the US civil war between the South and the North was dictated by economic efficiency and a better organization of energy and industrial bases by the North.

Our current civilization is, as a consequence, the expression of our knowledge. The technologies we have available shape it, similarly to how Roman civilization was shaped by the knowledge and the technology available at the time. We can start asking ourselves what are the limits of adaptability of our civilization, and how it will change with the accumulation of information, its application in new knowledge and new technologies. If you asked a Roman to tell you if it were possible to build a civilization without slaves, the answer would have been “No!”. What are the false axioms that we are holding? What are the questions that we can ask and assume that the answers would be universal, with everybody firmly believing that a given assumption is a necessary part of our societies in any place and any time? With the knowledge available to us in the future we’ll appear as primitive and naive with that secure and false answer as the Romans appear to us today.

When the shift happens, and how it manifests itself, depends on the tensions that build up between societies in a given era. What is possible in one place may not be immediately possible in an other place. Differences build up as a consequence, since knowledge gets applied and experience accrues. In a world of global communication as today, the understanding of these differences brings to the possibility of applying knowledge faster, adopting best practices, what works well, and avoiding mistakes. When communication barriers or ideological ones put obstacles in the path of this flow of information, the divergence of societies increases. The tensions accumulate, and under an apparent immobility, the organizational structure of society is under increasing stress. At that point a small change in the boundary conditions can bring to very big core changes, rippling through the entire society. 

This is what literally happened with the Berlin wall, which was metaphorically and physically shielding the planned economies of the USSR and of Eastern Europe from those of the West. When the Wall fell, the effects of allowing market economies to rapidly penetrate brought first economical and then swift political change which could not be contained or controlled even by the very people who initiated and allowed them, like then Secretary General of the Russian Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev.

Since the information differences create these areas of limited knowledge, individuals within those areas often don’t even realize that they are living in a maladapted society. They can be taken by surprise when the weaknesses and the brittleness of the civilization is made evident by the abrupt changes. Even political experts and historians are better at explaining rapid civilizational changes after the fact than not forecasting them. This makes it hard to prepare for the changes, and to reduce the amount of suffering that the period of uncertainty creates.
