### Access to the sacred text of your DNA

A recent example of this precautionary principle at work is the opposition of the US Food & Drug Administration, the federal agency that regulates food and healthcare products and services, to the DNA decoding service offered to the public by the 23andme company.

Taking advantage of the exponential reduction in decoding costs, in 2009 this Californian company began offering the public an innovative service. When you register on their site, they send you a test-tube: you deposit a sample of your saliva in the tube (put bluntly, you spit into it) and mail it back to the company in the envelope you received in the original package, prominently marked with the threatening “biohazard” icons for biological materials. After a couple of weeks, they send you an email message informing you that the decoding procedure has been completed. You can then read the results, protected by a password, directly on the company’s website.

In 1985, an extremely ambitious Human Genome Project was launched in the USA with a budget of three billion dollars. The goal was to decode the human genome, consisting of three billion base pairs, in fifteen years. The progress of the project is a classic example of the power of exponential change. Seven years in, only one percent of progress had been achieved. Even the experts in the field thought the project had failed and that it would take not another seven years, but dozens if not hundreds of years to complete, and involve astronomic costs many times higher than the funds originally provided. Very few people considered that the one percent result had been achieved through a doubling of the decoding capability. By maintaining this rhythm, not the speed, but the acceleration of the process, by the following year, 2% progress had been achieved, then 4%, 8%, 16%, 32%, 64%… and after exactly seven additional doublings, the 100% objective had been achieved on time – fifteen years – and on budget.

The doubling of the power of the project didn’t stop there, however; the speed of decoding increased, bringing down its cost. Today, in 2015, it is possible to have a complete DNA profile for about $2000, or for $99 a partial profile, of the so-called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (or SNIPs) believed to be responsible for the individual characteristics that distinguish us from one another. There are five hundred thousand SNIPs in human DNA and the 23andme company concentrates on their analysis and processing.

The results are astonishing. By analyzing my DNA, the people at 23andme can tell me the color of my eyes and hair, as well as dozens of other characteristics of my phenotype, that is, the physical manifestation of the action of my DNA. They can make a statistical assessment, in terms of greater or lesser predisposition toward specific types of illness. They provide indications on dosages even for common drugs if I should have to use them, in addition to the recommendations of normal prescriptions, or, conversely, advise a lower dose given my natural reaction to the compounds contained in the medicine.

Clearly, being able to take decisions on the basis of this information can have important consequences. Knowing that specific changes in my lifestyle can reduce the probability of a particular condition affecting me can be life-changing. Telling my doctor that I have a particular sensitivity to a drug he is about to prescribe so he can adjust the dose accordingly could save my life.

The FDA has decided that the way 23andme presents the information, making the probabilistic and statistical correlations between the genome, behavior and the development of particular conditions and diseases explicit, was not appropriate. Specifically, it has ruled that consumers should not have direct access to this information, which should be given only to physicians who would therefore be the only people to interpret the data and give advice to their patients based on their conclusions.

In 1517, Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg. His symbolic act was the trigger for the development of the Protestant movement in the Christian church, leading to a schism with Catholicism that continues today. One of Luther’s theses XXX was that the Bible, the sacred text of Christianity, should be translated from Latin into German to enable people to read it themselves, without the intermediation of a priest. The preexisting interests, as well as a conservative and dogmatic justification, created an irresolvable conflict that led not only to the schism in the church, but also to hundreds of years of bloody conflict.

Today the FDA is taking the role played by the Vatican in Luther’s day. It does not want people to have access to the sacred text of their DNA, translated from the language of biochemistry into the accessible language of information technology, and has ruled that interpretation of the text may only be through the priestly intermediation of medical practitioners, who uphold their position from a conservative and dogmatic basis.

### The proactionary principle

Our actions shape the future. The consequences of our hopes and ambitions extend beyond the present.

The precautionary principle dictates that before a given solution is adopted, it is necessary to take into consideration all the harm that it can cause. Often invoked in areas of consumer protection, regulators feel empowered by it to make sure that new products and services that are brought to market are not only useful and have positive effects, but that negative effects can be excluded. Especially in the fields of health and pharmaceutical research the cautionary principle has been the preeminent inspiration of product development.

Of course in an ideal world regulators would only seek to establish the best course of action for the public good, rather than implementing self-propagating bureaucracies. And in an ideal world dominant players in a given market would not use their power to stop newcomers and diminish the dangers of unknown competitive factors, distorting the rules, and unduly influencing the process. Yes, we are not living in an ideal world.

The precautionary principle, originally proposed by Max More[ˆproactionary], takes into account the opportunity cost of inaction, and the costs of regulation itself, in deriving a balance that is more future oriented. If we look at the future generations, and the benefit they derive from our actions, delaying the implementation of a new technology can have very large consequences.

The freedom to experiment, and the opportunity for individuals to gain knowledge outside of the officially sanctioned paths of research, objectivity, transparency and other components of the proactionary principle make it a useful tool to design novel action.

The XXX family has been afflicted by a rare condition for which there wasn’t a commercially available cure. The pharmaceutical company that actually started initial research on it evaluated that going through the regulatory obstacle course to bring to to market was not worth it. Of course for those directly impacted by the illness it is not a question of profit considerations. Thanks to modern communications, the availability of research, the family has been able to connect with others in their same situation, to purchase the rights to further develop the cure, and to successfully apply it to their own members and to those of other families similarly afflicted.

Based on the traditional approaches this could never have happened, both from a technological and regulatory point of view. There are countless other examples of bolder experimentation and free inquiry that await the application of the proactionary principle to achieve their goals and flourish. 

The European Union, based on environmental concerns, incorporated the precautionary principle in its fundamental treaties. Is it going to imply that the EU is more likely to refrain from adopting technologies than other socio-economic areas? Is this going to be the basis of a certain level of fossilization of European society? Or maybe it is the expression of this situation which already afflicts it?

###Fit or unfit civilizations
Is freedom an emergent property of self-organizing matter? We strongly believe to be endowed of free will, and most of our social structures are based on this. There is no physical foundation to it. The determinism of physical laws, quantum uncertainties notwithstanding, allows no space for the concept to hide and show its effects. Just as we are constantly moved to anthropomorphizing objects, animals, and phenomena, we are compelled to interpret decisions as made freely instead of being the consequence of the state of matter and its interactions, inside and outside of us.

Individual behavior aggregates to that of larger groups, and finally of societies. We judge the outcomes of individual decisions and consequences in civil and criminal law. We can judge the capacity of societies to engender the well being of its members, or, on the contrary, to be corrupt, unjust, and spreading confusion, violence and suffering. 

The capacity of a group of societies to generate well being doesn’t only depend on the aggregate decisions of its members. It also depends on what knowledge is actually available to them, and through them to it. The ancient Roman civilization created wonderful art and philosophy, and we rightly admire its achievements. However, it was organized at a fundamental level on slave labor, which today is universally condemned. Could it be different? Is it possible to imagine a Roman civilization that didn’t employ slavery? It is not, because the level of knowledge, and especially the energy availability that that knowledge generated, made it impossible to achieve its goals without resorting to the force of human muscle, or programmable humans, people you could tell what to do, and who’d do it, without talking back.

During its period of expansion, while able to draw on successful waves of slaves, the Roman civilization appeared to be well adapted. It was only an appearance, because it could not last.  Rome could not further expand, having basically conquered all the available land of what we call today Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and enslaved all the individuals that could be enslaved in those populations. At that point it went into decline and became incapable of resisting the changes coming, or adapting to them. This is of course an extremely simplistic representation of a long and complex history. There are many other forces at play beyond that of slaves or the lack of slaves. 

Today, with current knowledge, we can build societies and civilizations without slaves. Relying on chemical and soon solar energy, our decisions are driven by their more efficient use, and they outcompete the eventual alternatives. We are not morally superior to the Romans as individual human beings, we are taking advantage of the accumulated information and its applications. The outcome of the US civil war between the South and the North was dictated by economic efficiency and a better organization of energy and industrial bases by the North.

Our current civilization is, as a consequence, the expression of our knowledge. The technologies we have available shape it, similarly to how Roman civilization was shaped by the knowledge and the technology available at the time. We can start asking ourselves what are the limits of adaptability of our civilization, and how it will change with the accumulation of information, its application in new knowledge and new technologies. If you asked a Roman to tell you if it were possible to build a civilization without slaves, the answer would have been “No!”. What are the false axioms that we are holding? What are the questions that we can ask and assume that the answers would be universal, with everybody firmly believing that a given assumption is a necessary part of our societies in any place and any time? With the knowledge available to us in the future we’ll appear as primitive and naive with that secure and false answer as the Romans appear to us today.

When the shift happens, and how it manifests itself, depends on the tensions that build up between societies in a given era. What is possible in one place may not be immediately possible in an other place. Differences build up as a consequence, since knowledge gets applied and experience accrues. In a world of global communication as today, the understanding of these differences brings to the possibility of applying knowledge faster, adopting best practices, what works well, and avoiding mistakes. When communication barriers or ideological ones put obstacles in the path of this flow of information, the divergence of societies increases. The tensions accumulate, and under an apparent immobility, the organizational structure of society is under increasing stress. At that point a small change in the boundary conditions can bring to very big core changes, rippling through the entire society. 

This is what literally happened with the Berlin wall, which was metaphorically and physically shielding the planned economies of the USSR and of Eastern Europe from those of the West. When the Wall fell, the effects of allowing market economies to rapidly penetrate brought first economical and then swift political change which could not be contained or controlled even by the very people who initiated and allowed them, like then Secretary General of the Russian Communist Party, Mikhail Gorbachev.

Since the information differences create these areas of limited knowledge, individuals within those areas often don’t even realize that they are living in a maladapted society. They can be taken by surprise when the weaknesses and the brittleness of the civilization is made evident by the abrupt changes. Even political experts and historians are better at explaining rapid civilizational changes after the fact than not forecasting them. This makes it hard to prepare for the changes, and to reduce the amount of suffering that the period of uncertainty creates.
