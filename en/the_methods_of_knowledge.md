## The methods of knowledge

In order to survive, we must observe our environment, try to understand it, acquire resources we need, and plan actions in order to achieve our goals. Knowing what are the rules of the world, systematizing the knowledge and understanding how we can know better is useful to be better at surviving.

### The fatal error of the alchemists

In a world that is dominated by competition and the universal perception is that resources are scarse, it is natural to choose a strategy of secrecy. Gathering knowledge in secret gives an advantage to those who can exploit it against others. A closed and well guarded system of knowledge is a barrier that others have to overcome if they want to participate at the same level.

At the same time, a closed and secret system is also vulnerable to be isolated and suffering its own mistakes in isolation. Not being able to share its learnings, a community relying on secrecy is bound to be repeating mistakes because their lessons cannot be shared.

Medieval alchemists who were obsessed by the goal of transforming lead into gold, were unlucky enough to believe that using mercury would help in this quest. Unfortunately mercury is poisonous. Any alchemist who learned this fact, did it on his own, and suffered the consequences of this knowledge. The organization in secret societies blocked the possibility of learning from each other’s mistakes, and and the alchemists were bound to repeat them.

In today’s world still there is a lot of activity that is conducted similarly in secret. It is assumed that sharing it would weaken the position of those who compete for resources.

### Open science

The scientific revolution that Galilei started not only represented a clearer understanding of how theory and experiments needed to be related. It also paved the way for a profound shift in how knowledge and information was collected, checked, and spread. Without it being a necessary part of the scientific method itself, open collaboration allowed groups and individuals who took advantage of it, to more rapidly decide if a certain set of results was reliable.

Open science is fundamentally superior to closed approaches of knowledge gathering. Collaboration among people who share the goals and passions of a given field is enhanced by a common language and tools. Publishing the results that one group achieves allows an other group to run experiments against the new knowledge to confirm or disprove them. Interdisciplinary collaboration is enhanced by the ease with which practitioners outside of the group can approach it, building bridges of understanding that overcome specializations.

Today a fertile field of study made possible by the increasing digitalization of science and scientific publishing is that of meta-studies. Comparing and analyzing a large number of publications in a given field, it is possible to derive results not individually contained in any single one of them. Statistical tools reveal significant trends, and enhance the possibility of catching and eventually correcting methodological errors in the work previously published.
