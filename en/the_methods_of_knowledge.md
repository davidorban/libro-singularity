## The methods of knowledge

In order to survive, we must observe our environment, try to understand it, acquire resources we need, and plan actions in order to achieve our goals. Knowing what are the rules of the world, systematizing the knowledge and understanding how we can know better is useful to be better at surviving.

### The fatal error of the alchemists

In a world that is dominated by competition and the universal perception is that resources are scarse, it is natural to choose a strategy of secrecy. Gathering knowledge in secret gives an advantage to those who can exploit it against others. A closed and well guarded system of knowledge is a barrier that others have to overcome if they want to participate at the same level.

At the same time, a closed and secret system is also vulnerable to be isolated and suffering its own mistakes in isolation. Not being able to share its learnings, a community relying on secrecy is bound to be repeating mistakes because their lessons cannot be shared.

Medieval alchemists who were obsessed by the goal of transforming lead into gold, were unlucky enough to believe that using mercury would help in this quest. Unfortunately mercury is poisonous. Any alchemist who learned this fact, did it on his own, and suffered the consequences of this knowledge. The organization in secret societies blocked the possibility of learning from each otherâ€™s mistakes, and and the alchemists were bound to repeat them.
