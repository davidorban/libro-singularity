## The proactionary principle 
Our actions shape the future. The consequences of our hopes and ambitions extend beyond the present.

The precautionary principle dictates that before a given solution is adopted, it is necessary to take into consideration all the harm that it can cause. Often invoked in areas of consumer protection, regulators feel empowered by it to make sure that new products and services that are brought to market are not only useful and have positive effects, but that negative effects can be excluded. Especially in the fields of health and pharmaceutical research the cautionary principle has been the preeminent inspiration of product development.

Of course in an ideal world regulators would only seek to establish the best course of action for the public good, rather than implementing self-propagating bureaucracies. And in an ideal world dominant players in a given market would not use their power to stop newcomers and diminish the dangers of unknown competitive factors, distorting the rules, and unduly influencing the process. Yes, we are not living in an ideal world.

The precautionary principle, originally proposed by Max More[ˆproactionary], takes into account the opportunity cost of inaction, and the costs of regulation itself, in deriving a balance that is more future oriented. If we look at the future generations, and the benefit they derive from our actions, delaying the implementation of a new technology can have very large consequences.

The freedom to experiment, and the opportunity for individuals to gain knowledge outside of the officially sanctioned paths of research, objectivity, transparency and other components of the proactionary principle make it a useful tool to design novel action.

The XXX family has been afflicted by a rare condition for which there wasn’t a commercially available cure. The pharmaceutical company that actually started initial research on it evaluated that going through the regulatory obstacle course to bring to to market was not worth it. Of course for those directly impacted by the illness it is not a question of profit considerations. Thanks to modern communications, the availability of research, the family has been able to connect with others in their same situation, to purchase the rights to further develop the cure, and to successfully apply it to their own members and to those of other families similarly afflicted.

Based on the traditional approaches this could never have happened, both from a technological and regulatory point of view. There are countless other examples of bolder experimentation and free inquiry that await the application of the proactionary principle to achieve their goals and flourish. 

The European Union, based on environmental concerns, incorporated the precautionary principle in its fundamental treaties. Is it going to imply that the EU is more likely to refrain from adopting technologies than other socio-economic areas? Is this going to be the basis of a certain level of fossilization of European society? Or maybe it is the expression of this situation which already afflicts it?
